Apache Auth.

This directory contains the configuration file of Apache's Web Server to
simulate authentication files.

These assumed that /var/www/html is the web root and AllowOverides is "All".

The subdirectories here are copied to the /var/www/html directory.

Commands executed are in testcases/files/log/apache-auth with their
corresponding failure mechanism.
