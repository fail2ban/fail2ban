Depends: python, iptables
Description: bans IPs that cause multiple authentication errors
 Monitors (in daemon mode) or just scans log files (e.g. /var/log/auth.log,
 /var/log/apache/access.log) and temporarily bans failure-prone
 addresses by updating existing firewall rules.  Currently, by default, 
 supports ssh/apache but configuration can be easily extended for scanning
 the other ASCII log files. Firewall rules are given in the config file,
 thus it can be adopted to be used with a variety of firewalls (e.g. iptables,
 ipfwadm).
