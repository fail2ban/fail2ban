fail2ban for Debian
-------------------

This package is nearly 100% identical to the upstream version. It was merely
packaged to be installed on a Debian system.

Module log4py installed into lib/fail2ban directory because there is no package for not-developed-in-a-long-time fail2ban

See the file TODO.Debian for more details, as well as the Debian Bug Tracking
system.
