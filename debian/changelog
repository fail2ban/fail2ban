fail2ban (0.5.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

    problems finding iptables in the cases when PATH was not exported outside
    (cfengine, broken shell environment) (closes: #329304)
  * Removed -b from start-stop-daemon because fail2ban detahes on its own

    a note to README.Debian regarding necessity to specify full email
    address in MAIL:from (closes: #329722)

    email sent out by fail2ban (closes: #330311)
