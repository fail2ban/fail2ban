WARNING!

 Configuration file /etc/fail2ban.conf, failregex configuration
 parameter specificly, were changed in 0.5.4-5 to close reported
 security breach, and in 0.5.4-6 to close few other bugs.

updating from <0.5.4-5
 Unless configuration file (or corresponding failregex'es) gets updated,
 security breach is not closed and corresponding warning will be reported
 by the fail2ban (in the log files).

updating from <0.5.4-6
 Bugs #329163, #331695 dealing with changed iptables rules
 outside of fail2ban were fixed in 0.5.4-6, and require upgrade of the
 configuration file (fwcheck option was introduced) to take full
 advantage of the problem solution (otherwise some problems might
 persist)

 Please review the configuration file and make appropriate changes.
ENJOY!
