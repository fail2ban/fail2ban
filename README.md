## Fail2Ban: ban hosts that cause multiple authentication errors

Fail2Ban scans log files like `/var/log/auth.log` and bans IP addresses conducting
too many failed login attempts. It does this by updating system firewall rules
to reject new connections from those IP addresses, for a configurable amount
of time. Fail2Ban comes out-of-the-box ready to read many standard log files,
such as those for sshd and Apache, and is easily configured to read any log
file of your choosing, for any error you wish.

Though Fail2Ban is able to reduce the rate of incorrect authentication
attempts, it cannot eliminate the risk presented by weak authentication.
Set up services to use only two factor, or public/private authentication
mechanisms if you really want to protect services.

This README is a quick introduction to Fail2Ban. More documentation, FAQ, and HOWTOs
to be found on fail2ban(1) manpage, [Wiki](https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban/wiki),
[Developers documentation](https://fail2ban.readthedocs.io/)
and the website: https://www.fail2ban.org

Installation:
-------------

Fail2Ban is likely already packaged for your Linux distribution and [can be installed with a simple command](https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban/wiki/How-to-install-fail2ban-packages).

If your distribution is not listed, you can install from GitHub:

Required:
- [Python >= 3.5](https://www.python.org) or [PyPy3](https://pypy.org)
- python-setuptools (or python3-setuptools) for installation from source

Optional:
- [pyinotify >= 0.8.3](https://github.com/seb-m/pyinotify), may require:
  * Linux >= 2.6.13
- [systemd >= 204](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd) and python bindings:
  * [python-systemd package](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/python-systemd/index.html)
- [dnspython](http://www.dnspython.org/)
- [pyasyncore](https://pypi.org/project/pyasyncore/) and [pyasynchat](https://pypi.org/project/pyasynchat/) (normally bundled-in within fail2ban, for python 3.12+ only)


To install:

    tar xvfj fail2ban-master.tar.bz2
    cd fail2ban-master
    sudo python setup.py install
   
Alternatively, you can clone the source from GitHub to a directory of your choice, and do the install from there. Pick the correct branch, for example, master or 0.11

    git clone https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban.git
    cd fail2ban
    sudo python setup.py install 
    
This will install Fail2Ban into the python library directory. The executable
scripts are placed into `/usr/bin`, and configuration in `/etc/fail2ban`.

Fail2Ban should be correctly installed now. Just type:

    fail2ban-client -h

to see if everything is alright. You should always use fail2ban-client and
never call fail2ban-server directly.
You can verify that you have the correct version installed with 

    fail2ban-client version

Please note that the system init/service script is not automatically installed.
To enable fail2ban as an automatic service, simply copy the script for your
distro from the `files` directory to `/etc/init.d`. Example (on a Debian-based
system):

    cp files/debian-initd /etc/init.d/fail2ban
    update-rc.d fail2ban defaults
    service fail2ban start

Configuration:
--------------

You can configure Fail2Ban using the files in `/etc/fail2ban`. It is possible to
configure the server using commands sent to it by `fail2ban-client`. The
available commands are described in the fail2ban-client(1) manpage.  Also see
fail2ban(1) and jail.conf(5)  manpages for further references.

Code status:
