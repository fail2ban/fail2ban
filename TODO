Legend:

# partially done
* done

- Add timeout to external commands (signal alarm, watchdog
  thread, etc)

- New backend: pynotify

- Uniformize filters and actions name. Use the software name
  (openssh, postfix, proftp)

- Added <USER> tag for failregex. Add features using this
  information

- Look at the memory consumption. Decrease memory usage

- More detailed statistics

- Auto-enable function (search for log files), check
  modification date to see if service is still in use

- Improve parsing of the action parameters in jailreader.py

- Better handling of the protocol in transmitter.py

- Add gettext support (I18N)

- Fix the cPickle issue with Python 2.5

- Multiline log reading

- Improve communication. (asyncore, asynchat??)

- Improve execution of action. Why does subprocess.call
  deadlock with multi-jails?

# see Feature Request Tracking System at SourceForge.net

# improve documentation and website for user
