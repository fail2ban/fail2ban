================================================================================
ToDo
================================================================================

Legend:
- not yet done
? maybe
# partially done
* done

- more detailed explaination in DEVELOP for new developers (eg. howto build this HEX numbers in ChangeLog)

- Run tests though all filters/examples files - (see sshd example file) as unit
  test

* Removed relative imports

* Cleanup fail2ban-client and fail2ban-server. Move code to server/ and client/

- Add timeout to external commands (signal alarm, watchdog thread, etc)

- Uniformize filters and actions name. Use the software name (openssh, postfix,
  proftp) and possible qualifier (e.g. auth) after a '-'

- Added <USER> tag for failregex. Add features using this information. Maybe add
  more tags

- Look at the memory consumption. Decrease memory usage

- More detailed statistics

- Auto-enable function (search for log files), check modification date to see if
  service is still in use

- Improve parsing of the action parameters in jailreader.py

- Better handling of the protocol in transmitter.py

- Add gettext support (I18N)

- Multiline log reading

- Improve execution of action. Why does subprocess.call deadlock with
  multi-jails?

# see Feature Request Tracking System at SourceForge.net

# improve documentation and website for user

# better return values in function

# refactoring in server.py, actions.py, filter.py

* New backend: pyinotify
