Fail2Ban (version 0.8.4)                                              2009/09/07
================================================================================

Fail2Ban scans log files like /var/log/pwdfail and bans IP that makes too many
password failures. It updates firewall rules to reject the IP address. These
rules can be defined by the user. Fail2Ban can read multiple log files such as
sshd or Apache web server ones.

This README is a quick introduction to Fail2ban. More documentation, FAQ, HOWTOs
are available on the project website: http://www.fail2ban.org

Installation:
-------------

Required:
   >=python-2.3 (http://www.python.org)

Optional:
   >=gamin-0.0.21 (http://www.gnome.org/~veillard/gamin)

To install, just do:

> tar xvfj fail2ban-0.8.4.tar.bz2
> cd fail2ban-0.8.4
> python setup.py install

This will install Fail2Ban into /usr/share/fail2ban. The executable scripts are
placed into /usr/bin.

It is possible that Fail2ban is already packaged for your distribution. In this
case, you should use it.

Fail2Ban should be correctly installed now. Just type:

> fail2ban-client -h

to see if everything is alright. You should always use fail2ban-client and never
call fail2ban-server directly.

Configuration:
--------------

You can configure Fail2ban using the files in /etc/fail2ban. It is possible to
configure the server using commands sent to it by fail2ban-client. The available
commands are described in the man page of fail2ban-client. Please refer to it or
