# WARNING: heavily refactored in 0.9.0 release.  Please review and
#          customize settings for your setup.
#
# Changes:  in most of the cases you should not modify this
#           file, but provide customizations in jail.local file,
#           or separate .conf files under jail.d/ directory, e.g.:
#
# HOW TO ACTIVATE JAILS:
#
# YOU SHOULD NOT MODIFY THIS FILE.
#
# It will probably be overwritten or improved in a distribution update.
#
# Provide customizations in a jail.local file or a jail.d/customisation.local.
# For example to change the default bantime for all jails and to enable the
# ssh-iptables jail the following (uncommented) would appear in the .local file.
# See man 5 jail.conf for details.
#
# [DEFAULT]
# bantime = 1h
#
# [sshd]
# enabled = true
#
# See jail.conf(5) man page for more information



# Comments: use '#' for comment lines and ';' (following a space) for inline comments

# The DEFAULT allows a global definition of the options. They can be overridden
# in each jail afterwards.

#
# MISCELLANEOUS OPTIONS
#

# "bantime.increment" allows to use database for searching of previously banned ip's to increase a 
# default ban time using special formula, default it is banTime * 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32...
#bantime.increment = true

# "bantime.rndtime" is the max number of seconds using for mixing with random time 
# to prevent "clever" botnets calculate exact time IP can be unbanned again:
#bantime.rndtime = 

# "bantime.maxtime" is the max number of seconds using the ban time can reach (doesn't grow further)
#bantime.maxtime = 

# "bantime.factor" is a coefficient to calculate exponent growing of the formula or common multiplier,
# default value of factor is 1 and with default value of formula, the ban time 
# grows by 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 ...
#bantime.factor = 1

# "bantime.formula" used by default to calculate next value of ban time, default value below,
# the same ban time growing will be reached by multipliers 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32...
#bantime.formula = ban.Time * (1<<(ban.Count if ban.Count<20 else 20)) * banFactor
#
# more aggressive example of formula has the same values only for factor "2.0 / 2.885385" :
#bantime.formula = ban.Time * math.exp(float(ban.Count+1)*banFactor)/math.exp(1*banFactor)

# "bantime.multipliers" used to calculate next value of ban time instead of formula, corresponding
# previously ban count and given "bantime.factor" (for multipliers default is 1);
# following example grows ban time by 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 ... and if last ban count greater as multipliers count, 
# always used last multiplier (64 in example), for factor '1' and original ban time 600 - 10.6 hours
#bantime.multipliers = 1 2 4 8 16 32 64
# following example can be used for small initial ban time (bantime=60) - it grows more aggressive at begin,
# for bantime=60 the multipliers are minutes and equal: 1 min, 5 min, 30 min, 1 hour, 5 hour, 12 hour, 1 day, 2 day
#bantime.multipliers = 1 5 30 60 300 720 1440 2880

# "bantime.overalljails" (if true) specifies the search of IP in the database will be executed 
# cross over all jails, if false (default), only current jail of the ban IP will be searched
#bantime.overalljails = false

# --------------------

# "ignoreself" specifies whether the local resp. own IP addresses should be ignored
# (default is true). Fail2ban will not ban a host which matches such addresses.
#ignoreself = true

# "ignoreip" can be a list of IP addresses, CIDR masks or DNS hosts. Fail2ban
# will not ban a host which matches an address in this list. Several addresses
# can be defined using space (and/or comma) separator.

# "maxmatches" is the number of matches stored in ticket (resolvable via tag <matches> in actions).
maxmatches = %(maxretry)s

# "backend" specifies the backend used to get files modification.
# Available options are "pyinotify", "gamin", "polling", "systemd" and "auto".
# This option can be overridden in each jail as well.
#
# pyinotify: requires pyinotify (a file alteration monitor) to be installed.
#              If pyinotify is not installed, Fail2ban will use auto.
# gamin:     requires Gamin (a file alteration monitor) to be installed.
#              If Gamin is not installed, Fail2ban will use auto.
# polling:   uses a polling algorithm which does not require external libraries.
# systemd:   uses systemd python library to access the systemd journal.
#              Specifying "logpath" is not valid for this backend.
#              See "journalmatch" in the jails associated filter config
# auto:      will try to use the following backends, in order:
#              pyinotify, gamin, polling.
#
# Note: if systemd backend is chosen as the default but you enable a jail
#       for which logs are present only in its own log files, specify some other
#       backend for that jail (e.g. polling) and provide empty value for
#       journalmatch. See https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban/issues/959#issuecomment-74901200
backend = auto

# "usedns" specifies if jails should trust hostnames in logs,
#   warn when DNS lookups are performed, or ignore all hostnames in logs
#
# yes:   if a hostname is encountered, a DNS lookup will be performed.
# warn:  if a hostname is encountered, a DNS lookup will be performed,
#        but it will be logged as a warning.
# no:    if a hostname is encountered, will not be used for banning,
#        but it will be logged as info.
# raw:   use raw value (no hostname), allow use it for no-host filters/actions (example user)
usedns = warn

# "logencoding" specifies the encoding of the log files handled by the jail
#   This is used to decode the lines from the log file.
#   Typical examples:  "ascii", "utf-8"
#
#   auto:   will use the system locale setting
logencoding = auto

# "enabled" enables the jails.
#  By default all jails are disabled, and it should stay this way.
#  Enable only relevant to your setup jails in your .local or jail.d/*.conf
#
# true:  jail will be enabled and log files will get monitored for changes
# false: jail is not enabled
