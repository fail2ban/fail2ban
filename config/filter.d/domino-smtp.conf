# Option:  failregex
# Notes.:  regex to match the password failure messages in the logfile. The
#          host must be matched by a group named "host". The tag "<HOST>" can
#          be used for standard IP/hostname matching and is only an alias for
#          (?:::f{4,6}:)?(?P<host>\S+)
# Values:  TEXT
#
# Sample log entries (used different time formats and an extra sample with process info in front of date)
# 01/23/2009 19:54:51   SMTP Server: Authentication failed for user bd ; connecting host 125.120.107.140
# [28325:00010-3735542592] 22.06.2014 09:56:12   smtp: brian [74.208.72.28] authentication failure using internet password
# 08.09.2014 06:14:27   smtp: drweb [81.82.251.231] authentication failure using internet password
# 08.09.2014 06:14:27   SMTP Server: Authentication failed for user drweb ; connecting host 81.82.251.231
