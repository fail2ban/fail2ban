# Fail2Ban configuration file
#
# Author: Eduardo Diaz
#
# This is for ipset protocol 6 (and hopefully later) (ipset v6.14).
# for shorewall
#
# This requires the program ipset which is normally in package called ipset.
#
# IPset was a feature introduced in the linux kernel 2.6.39 and 3.0.0 kernels.
#
# If you are running on an older kernel you make need to patch in external
# modules.
# Enable to shorewall use a blacklist using ipset creating a file /etc/shorewall/blacklist
# and adding +f2b-shorewall to this file see details in shorewall documentation blacklist ipset
# to enable restore you ipset You must set SAVE_IPSETS=Yes in shorewall.conf, restart fail2ban
# and restart shorewall to create the ipset at first. 
# Is importan to read this documentation from shorewall http://shorewall.net/ipsets.html
