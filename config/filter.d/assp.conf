# Option:  failregex
# Notes.:  regex to match the SMTP failure messages in the logfile. The
#          host must be matched by a group named "host". The tag "<HOST>" can
#          be used for standard IP/hostname matching and is only an alias for
#          (?:::f{4,6}:)?(?P<host>\S+)
# Values:  TEXT
#
# Examples: Apr-27-13 02:33:09 Blocking 217.194.197.97 - too much AUTH errors (41);
#           Dec-29-12 17:10:31 [SSL-out] 200.247.87.82 SSL negotiation with client failed: SSL accept attempt failed with unknown errorerror:140760FC:SSL routines:SSL23_GET_CLIENT_HELLO:unknown protocol;
#           Dec-30-12 04:01:47 [SSL-out] 81.82.232.66 max sender authentication errors (5) exceeded 
__assp_actions = (dropping|refusing)
