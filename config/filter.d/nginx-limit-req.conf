# Fail2ban filter configuration for nginx :: limit_req
# used to ban hosts, that were failed through nginx by limit request processing rate 
#
# Author: Serg G. Brester (sebres)
#
# To use 'nginx-limit-req' filter you should have `ngx_http_limit_req_module`
# and define `limit_req` and `limit_req_zone` as described in nginx documentation
# http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_limit_req_module.html
#
# Example:
#
#   http {
#     ...
#     limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=lr_zone:10m rate=1r/s;
#     ...
#     # http, server, or location:
#     location ... {
#       limit_req zone=lr_zone burst=1 nodelay;
#       ...
#     }
#     ...
#   }
#   ...
#

[Definition]

# Specify following expression to define exact zones, if you want to ban IPs limited 
# from specified zones only.
# Example:
#
#   ngx_limit_req_zones = lr_zone|lr_zone2
#
ngx_limit_req_zones = [^"]+

# Use following full expression if you should range limit request to specified 
# servers, requests, referrers etc. only :
#
# failregex = ^\s*\[[a-z]+\] \d+#\d+: \*\d+ limiting requests, excess: [\d\.]+ by zone "(?:%(ngx_limit_req_zones)s)", client: <HOST>, server: \S*, request: "\S+ \S+ HTTP/\d+\.\d+", host: "\S+"(, referrer: "\S+")?\s*$

# Shortly, much faster and stable version of regexp:
failregex = ^\s*\[[a-z]+\] \d+#\d+: \*\d+ limiting requests, excess: [\d\.]+ by zone "(?:%(ngx_limit_req_zones)s)", client: <HOST>,
