# Fail2Ban configuration file
#
# Dead-simple filter to catch requests to non-existent pages.
# Make sure all your page dependencies are in the server before enabling this.
# Sometimes images or scripts for example can be missing without giving notice, in which case all hosts will be quickly banned!
# Also make sure you have properly configured findtime and maxretry in your jail.local file.
# If for example findtime=600 and maxretry=10 then 10 invalid requests during 10 mins will block the host.
