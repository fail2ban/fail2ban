# Fail2Ban filter for unsuccesful MySQL authentication attempts
#
#
# To log wrong MySQL access attempts add to /etc/my.cnf in [mysqld]:
# log-error=/var/log/mysqld.log
# log-warning = 2
#
# If using mysql syslog [mysql_safe] has syslog in /etc/my.cnf

[INCLUDES]

# Read common prefixes. If any customizations available -- read them from
# common.local
before = common.conf

[Definition]

# DEV Notes:
#
# Technically __prefix_line can equate to an empty string hence it can support
# syslog and non-syslog at once.
# Example:
# 130322 11:26:54 [Warning] Access denied for user 'root'@'127.0.0.1' (using password: YES)
