# Fail2Ban configuration file for generic SELinux audit messages

# This file is not intended to be used directly, and should be included into a
# filter file which would define following variables. See selinux-ssh.conf as
# and example.
#
# _type
# _uid
# _auid 
# _subj
# _msg
#
# Also one of these variables must include <HOST>.
