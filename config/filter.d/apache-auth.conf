# DEV Notes:
#
# This filter matches the authorization failures of Apache. It takes the log messages
# from the modules in aaa that return HTTP_UNAUTHORIZED, HTTP_METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED or
# HTTP_FORBIDDEN and not AUTH_GENERAL_ERROR or HTTP_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR.
#
# An unauthorized response 401 is the first step for a browser to instigate authentication
# however apache doesn't log this as an error. Only subsequent errors are logged in the 
# error log.
#
# Source:
#
# By searching the code in http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/httpd/httpd/trunk/modules/aaa/*
# for ap_log_rerror(APLOG_MARK, APLOG_ERR and examining resulting return code should get
# all of these expressions. Lots of submodules like mod_authz_* return back to mod_authz_core
# to return the actual failure.
#
# See also: http://wiki.apache.org/httpd/ListOfErrors
# Expressions that don't have tests and aren't common.
# more be added with  https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=55284
