[Definition]

# Option:  failregex
# Notes.:  regex to match failures to find a home directory on a server, which
#          became popular last days. Most often attacker just uses IP instead of
#          domain name -- so expect to see them in generic error.log if you have
#          per-domain log files.
# Values:  TEXT

# Option:  ignoreregex
# Notes.:  regex to ignore. If this regex matches, the line is ignored.
