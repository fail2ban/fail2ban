# DEV Notes:
#
# Regarding the multiline regex:
#
# There can be a number of non-related lines between the first and second part
# of this regex maxlines of 10 is quite generious.
#
# Note the capture __connid, includes the connection ID, used in second part of regex.
#
# The first regex is commented out (but will match also), because it is better to use
# the host from "end connection" line (uncommented above):
#  -  it has the same prefix, searching begins directly with failure message
#     (so faster, because ignores success connections at all)
#  -  it is not so vulnerable in case of possible race condition
#
# Log example:
