# Option:  failregex
# Notes.:  regex to match the password failures messages
# in the logfile. The host must be matched by a
# group named "host". The tag "<HOST>" can
# be used for standard IP/hostname matching and is
# only an alias for
#          (?:::f{4,6}:)?(?P<host>[\w\-.^_]+)
# Values:  TEXT
#
#
# CONFIGURATION REQUIREMENTS FOR ORACLE IMS v6 and ABOVE:
#
# In OPTION.DAT you must have LOG_FORMAT=4 and
#  bit 5 of LOG_CONNECTION must be set. 
#
# Many of these sub-fields are optional and can be turned on and off
# by the system manager.  We need the "tr" field
#  (transport information (present if bit 5 of LOG_CONNECTION is
# set and transport information is available)).
# "di" should be there by default if you have LOG_FORMAT=4.
# Do not use "mi" as this is not included by default.
#
# Typical line IF YOU ARE USING TAGGING ! ! ! is:
# <co ts="2014-06-02T09:45:50.29" pi="123f.3f8.4397"
# sc="tcp_local" dr="+" ac="U"
# tr="TCP|192.245.12.223|25|151.1.71.144|59762" ap="SMTP"
# mi="Bad password"
# us="01ko8hqnoif09qx0np@imap.opus1.com"
# di="535 5.7.8 Bad username or password (Authentication failed)."/>
# Format is generally documented in the PORT_ACCESS mapping 
# at http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19563-01/819-4428/bgaur/index.html
#
# All that would be on one line.
# Note that you MUST have LOG_FORMAT=4 for this to work!

# Option:  ignoreregex
# Notes.:  regex to ignore. If this regex matches, the line is ignored.
# Values:  TEXT
