# Option:  failregex
# Notes.:  regex to match the password failures messages in the logfile. The
#          host must be matched by a group named "host". The tag "<HOST>" can
#          be used for standard IP/hostname matching and is only an alias for
#          (?:::f{4,6}:)?(?P<host>\S+)
# Values:  TEXT

# These match the unmodified dropbear messages. It isn't possible to
# match the source of the 'exit before auth' messages from dropbear.
#
failregex = ^%(__prefix_line)slogin attempt for nonexistent user ('.*' )?from <HOST>:.*\s*$
            ^%(__prefix_line)sbad password attempt for .+ from <HOST>:.*\s*$

# The only line we need to match with the modified dropbear.

# NOTE: The failregex below is ONLY intended to work with a patched
# version of Dropbear as described here:
# http://www.unchartedbackwaters.co.uk/pyblosxom/static/patches
#
# The standard Dropbear output doesn't provide enough information to
# ban all types of attack.  The Dropbear patch adds IP address
# information to the 'exit before auth' message which is always
# produced for any form of non-successful login. It is that message
# which this file matches.

# failregex = ^%(__prefix_line)sexit before auth from <HOST>.*\s*$

# Option:  ignoreregex
# Notes.:  regex to ignore. If this regex matches, the line is ignored.
# Values:  TEXT
