# Fail2Ban filter to match web requests for selected URLs that don't exist
#
# This filter is aimed at blocking specific URLs that don't exist. This
# could be a set of URLs places in a Disallow: directive in robots.txt or
# just some web services that don't exist caused bots are searching for
# exploitable content. This filter is designed to have a low false postitive
# rate due.
#
# An alternative to this is the apache-noscript filter which blocks all
# types of scripts that don't exist.
#
#
# This is normally a predefined list of exploitable or valuable web services
# that are hidden or aren't actually installed.
#

[INCLUDES]

# overwrite with apache-common.local if _apache_error_client is incorrect.
# Load regexes for filtering from botsearch-common.conf
before = apache-common.conf
