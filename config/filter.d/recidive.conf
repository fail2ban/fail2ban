# Fail2Ban filter for repeat bans
#
# This filter monitors the fail2ban log file, and enables you to add long 
# time bans for ip addresses that get banned by fail2ban multiple times.
#
# Reasons to use this: block very persistent attackers for a longer time, 
# stop receiving email notifications about the same attacker over and 
# over again.
#
# This jail is only useful if you set the 'findtime' and 'bantime' parameters 
# in jail.conf to a higher value than the other jails. Also, this jail has its
# drawbacks, namely in that it works only with iptables, or if you use a 
# different blocking mechanism for this jail versus others (e.g. hostsdeny 
# for most jails, and shorewall for this one).
