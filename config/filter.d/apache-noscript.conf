# Fail2Ban filter to block web requests for scripts (on non scripted websites)
#
# This matches many types of scripts that don't exist. This could generate a
# lot of false positive matches in cases like wikis and forums where users
# no affiliated with the website can insert links to missing files/scripts into
# pages and cause non-malicious browsers of the site to trigger against this
# filter.
#
# If you'd like to match specific URLs that don't exist see the
# apache-botsearch filter.

# overwrite with apache-common.local if _apache_error_client is incorrect.
