# Fail2ban filter configuration for nginx :: ModSecurity-nginx (nginx-modsec)
# used to ban hosts, that were failed through nginx by the rate of ModSecurity events 
#
# Author: Charlie Hsieh (charlietag)
#
# To use 'modsecurity' filter you should have `ngx_http_modsecurity_module.so`
# and define `modsecurity` and `modsecurity_rules_file` as described in ModSecurity-nginx documentation
# https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity-nginx
#
# Example:
#
#   http {
#     ...
#     modsecurity on;
#     ...
#     # http, server, or location:
#     location ... {
#       modsecurity_rules_file /etc/my_modsecurity_rules.conf;
#       ...
#     }
#     ...
#   }
#   ...
