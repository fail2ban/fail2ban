# Fail2Ban configuration file for roundcube web server
#
# By default failed logins are printed to 'errors'. The first regex matches those
# The second regex matches those printed to 'userlogins'
#   The userlogins log file can be enabled by setting $config['log_logins'] = true; in config.inc.php
#
# The logpath in your jail can be updated to userlogins if you wish

#
# Part after <HOST> comes straight from IMAP server up until the " in ....."
# Earlier versions didn't log the IMAP response hence optional.
#
# DoS resistance:
#
# Assume that the user can inject "from <HOST>" into the imap response
# somehow. Write test cases around this to ensure that the combination of
# arbitrary user input and IMAP response doesn't inject the wrong IP for
# fail2ban
