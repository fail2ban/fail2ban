# Source: https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/blob/master/program/lib/Roundcube/rcube_imap.php#L180
#
# Part after <HOST> comes straight from IMAP server up until the " in ....."
# Earlier versions didn't log the IMAP response hence optional.
#
# DoS resistance:
#
# Assume that the user can inject "from <HOST>" into the imap response
# somehow. Write test cases around this to ensure that the combination of 
# arbitary user input and IMAP response doesn't inject the wrong IP for 
# fail2ban
