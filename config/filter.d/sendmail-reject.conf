# Fail2Ban filter for sendmail spam/relay type failures
#
# Some of the below failregex will only work properly, when the following
# options are set in the .mc file (see your Sendmail documentation on how
# to modify it and generate the corresponding .cf file):
#
# FEATURE(`delay_checks')
# FEATURE(`greet_pause', `500')
# FEATURE(`ratecontrol', `nodelay', `terminate')
# FEATURE(`conncontrol', `nodelay', `terminate')
#
# ratecontrol and conncontrol also need corresponding options ClientRate:
# and ClientConn: in the access file, see documentation for ratecontrol and
# conncontrol in the sendmail/cf/README file.

# DEV NOTES:
# 
# Regarding the multiline regex:
#
# "No such user" lines generate a failure and needs to be matched together with
# another line with the HOST, therefore no-failure line was added as regex, that
# contains HOST (see line with tag <F-NOFAIL>).
#
# Note the capture <F-MLFID>, includes both the __prefix_lines (which includes
# the sendmail PID), but also the `\w{14}` which the the sendmail assigned 
# mail ID (todo: check this is necessary, possible obsolete).
