# Fail2Ban filter for sendmail spam/relay type failures
#
# Some of the below failregex will only work properly, when the following
# options are set in the .mc file (see your Sendmail documentation on how
# to modify it and generate the corresponding .cf file):
#
# FEATURE(`delay_checks')
# FEATURE(`greet_pause', `500')
# FEATURE(`ratecontrol', `nodelay', `terminate')
# FEATURE(`conncontrol', `nodelay', `terminate')
#
# ratecontrol and conncontrol also need corresponding options ClientRate:
# and ClientConn: in the access file, see documentation for ratecontrol and
# conncontrol in the sendmail/cf/README file.

# "maxlines" is number of log lines to buffer for multi-line regex searches
maxlines = 10

# DEV NOTES:
# 
# Regarding the last multiline regex:
#
# There can be a nunber of non-related lines between the first and second part
# of this regex maxlines of 10 is quite generious. Only one of the 
# "No such user" lines needs to be matched before the line with the HOST.
#
# Note the capture __prefix, includes both the __prefix_lines (which includes
# the sendmail PID), but also the \w+ which the the sendmail assigned mail ID.
