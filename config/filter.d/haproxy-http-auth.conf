# Fail2Ban filter configuration file to match failed login attempts to
# HAProxy HTTP Authentication protected servers.
#
# PLEASE NOTE - When a user first hits the HTTP Auth a 401 is returned by the server
# which prompts their browser to ask for login details.
# This initial 401 is logged by HAProxy.
# In other words, even successful logins will have at least 1 fail regex match.
# Please keep this in mind when setting findtime and maxretry for jails.
