# positives on misconfigured MTAs.

# DEV Notes
# -----------
# The %(host_info) definition contains a <ADDR> match. No space before. See exim-common.conf
#
# SMTP protocol synchronization error \([^)]*\)  <- This needs to be non-greedy
# to void capture beyond ")" to avoid a DoS Injection vulnerability as input= is
# user injectable data.
