# Parameter `mode` - `normal` or `aggressive`.
# Aggressive mode can be used to match flood and ddos-similar log-entries like:
#   'no host found for IP', 'no IP found for host'.
# Note this is not an authentication failures, so it may produce lots of false 
# positives on misconfigured MTAs.
# Ex.:
#   filter = exim[mode=aggressive]
mode = normal

# DEV Notes:
# The %(host_info) defination contains a <HOST> match
#
# SMTP protocol synchronization error \([^)]*\)  <- This needs to be non-greedy
# to void capture beyond ")" to avoid a DoS Injection vulnerabilty as input= is
# user injectable data.
