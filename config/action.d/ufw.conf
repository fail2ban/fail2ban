# Fail2Ban action configuration file for ufw
#
# You are required to run "ufw enable" before this will have any effect.
# Please ensure `ss` program from the iproute2 package is installed
# to close already established connections.
#
# The insert position should be appropriate to block the required traffic.
# A number after an allow rule to the application won't be of much use.

# therefore all IPv4/IPv6 sockets should be closed - action is using `ss` to do so.
