# Fail2Ban configuration file

# Author: Russell Odom <russ@gloomytrousers.co.uk>
# Sends a complaint e-mail to addresses listed in the whois record for an
# offending IP address.
#
# You should provide the <logpath> in the jail config - lines from the log
# matching the given IP address will be provided in the complaint as evidence.
#
# Note that we will try to use e-mail addresses that are most likely to be abuse
# addresses (based on various keywords). If they aren't found we fall back on
# any other addresses found in the whois record, with a few exceptions.
# If no addresses are found, no e-mail is sent.
