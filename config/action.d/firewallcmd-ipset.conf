# Fail2Ban action file for firewall-cmd/ipset
#
# This requires:
# ipset (package: ipset)
# firewall-cmd (package: firewalld)
#
# This is for ipset protocol 6 (and hopefully later) (ipset v6.14).
# Use ipset -V to see the protocol and version.
#
# IPset was a feature introduced in the linux kernel 2.6.39 and 3.0.0 kernels.
#
# If you are running on an older kernel you make need to patch in external
# modules.
