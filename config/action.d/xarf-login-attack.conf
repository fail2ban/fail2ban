# Fail2Ban action for sending xarf Login-Attack messages to IP owner
#
# IMPORTANT:
#
# Emailing a IP owner of abuse is a serious complain. Make sure that it is
# serious. Fail2ban developers and network owners recommend you only use this
# action for:
#   * The recidive where the IP has been banned multiple times
#   * Where maxretry has been set quite high, beyond the normal user typing
#     password incorrectly.
#   * For filters that have a low likelihood of receiving human errors
#
# DEPENDENCIES:
#
# This requires the dig command from bind-utils
#
# This uses the https://abusix.com/contactdb.html to lookup abuse contacts.
#
# XARF is a specification for sending a formatted response
# for non-messaging based abuse including:
#
# Login-Attack, Malware-Attack, Fraud (Phishing, etc.), Info DNSBL
#
# For details see:
# https://github.com/xarf/xarf-specification
