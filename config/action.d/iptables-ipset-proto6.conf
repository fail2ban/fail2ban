# Fail2Ban configuration file
#
# Author: Daniel Black
#
# This is for ipset protocol 6 (and hopefully later) (ipset v6.14).
# Use ipset -V to see the protocol and version. Version 4 should use
# iptables-ipset-proto4.conf.
#
# This requires the program ipset which is normally in package called ipset.
#
# IPset was a feature introduced in the linux kernel 2.6.39 and 3.0.0 kernels.
#
# If you are running on an older kernel you make need to patch in external
# modules.
#
# On Debian machines this can be done with:
#
# apt-get install ipset xtables-addons-source 
# module-assistant auto-install xtables-addons

[INCLUDES]

before = iptables-blocktype.conf


[Definition]

# Option:  actionstart
# Notes.:  command executed once at the start of Fail2Ban.
# Values:  CMD
#
actionstart = ipset create fail2ban-<name> hash:ip timeout <bantime>
              iptables -I INPUT -p <protocol> -m multiport --dports <port> -m set --match-set fail2ban-<name> src -j DROP

# Option:  actionstop
# Notes.:  command executed once at the end of Fail2Ban
# Values:  CMD
#
actionstop = iptables -D INPUT -p <protocol> -m multiport --dports <port> -m set --match-set fail2ban-<name> src -j DROP
             ipset flush fail2ban-<name>
             ipset destroy fail2ban-<name>

# Option:  actionban
# Notes.:  command executed when banning an IP. Take care that the
#          command is executed with Fail2Ban user rights.
# Tags:    See jail.conf(5) man page
# Values:  CMD
#
actionban = ipset add fail2ban-<name> <ip> timeout <bantime> -exist

# Option:  actionunban
# Notes.:  command executed when unbanning an IP. Take care that the
#          command is executed with Fail2Ban user rights.
# Tags:    See jail.conf(5) man page
# Values:  CMD

[Init]

# Default name of the ipset
#
name = default

# Option:  port
# Notes.:  specifies port to monitor
# Values:  [ NUM | STRING ]  Default: ssh
#
port = ssh

# Option:  protocol
# Notes.:  internally used by config reader for interpolations.
# Values:  [ tcp | udp | icmp | all ] Default: tcp
#
protocol = tcp

# Option: bantime
# Notes:  specifies the bantime in seconds (handled internally rather than by fail2ban)
# Values:  [ NUM ]  Default: 600

bantime = 600
