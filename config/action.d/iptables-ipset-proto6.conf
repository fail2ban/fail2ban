# Fail2Ban configuration file
#
# Author: Daniel Black
#
# This is for ipset protocol 6 (and hopefully later) (ipset v6.14).
# Use ipset -V to see the protocol and version. Version 4 should use
# iptables-ipset-proto4.conf.
#
# This requires the program ipset which is normally in package called ipset.
#
# IPset was a feature introduced in the linux kernel 2.6.39 and 3.0.0 kernels.
#
# If you are running on an older kernel you make need to patch in external
# modules.
#
# Modified: Alexander Koeppe <format_c@online.de>, Serg G. Brester <serg.brester@sebres.de>
#       made config file IPv6 capable (see new section Init?family=inet6)
