# Mikrotik routerOS action to add/remove address-list entries
#
# Author: Duncan Bellamy <dunk@denkimushi.com>
# based on forum.mikrotik.com post by pakjebakmeel
#
# in the instructions:
# (10.0.0.1 is ip of mikrotik router)
# (10.0.0.2 is ip of fail2ban machine)
#
# on fail2ban machine:
# sudo mkdir /var/lib/fail2ban/ssh
# sudo chmod 700 /var/lib/fail2ban/ssh
# sudo ssh-keygen -N "" -f /var/lib/fail2ban/ssh/fail2ban_id_rsa
# sudo scp /var/lib/fail2ban/ssh/fail2ban_id_rsa.pub admin@10.0.0.1:/
# ssh admin@10.0.0.1
#
# on mikrotik router:
# /user add name=miki-f2b group=write address=10.0.0.2 password=""
# /user ssh-keys import public-key-file=fail2ban_id_rsa.pub user=miki-f2b
# /quit
#
# on fail2ban machine:
# (check password login fails)
# ssh miki-f2b@10.0.0.1
# (check private key works)
# sudo ssh -i /var/lib/fail2ban/ssh/fail2ban_id_rsa miki-f2b@10.0.0.1
#
# Then create rules on mikrorik router that use address
# list(s) maintained by fail2ban eg in the forward chain
# drop from address list, or in the forward chain drop
# from address list to server
#
# example extract from jail.local overriding some defaults
# action = mikrotik[keyfile="%(mkeyfile)s", user="%(muser)s", host="%(mhost)s", list="%(mlist)s"]
#
# ignoreip = 127.0.0.1/8 192.168.0.0/24

# mkeyfile = /etc/fail2ban/ssh/mykey_id_rsa
# muser = myuser
# mhost = 192.168.0.1
# mlist = BAD LIST
