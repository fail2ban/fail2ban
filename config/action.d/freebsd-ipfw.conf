# Option:  actionban
# Notes.:  command executed when banning an IP. Take care that the
#          command is executed with Fail2Ban user rights.

o <localhost> <port> in via <nic>`

# Option:  actionunban
# Notes.:  command executed when unbanning an IP. Take care that the
#          command is executed with Fail2Ban user rights.
# Tags:    See jail.conf(5) man page

[Init]

# Option:  port
# Notes.:  specifies port to monitor
# Values:  [ NUM | STRING ]
#
port = ssh

# Option:  localhost
# Notes.:  the local IP address of the network interface
# Values:  IP
#
localhost = 127.0.0.1
# first nic on system
localhost = me 


# Option:  blocktype
# Notes.:  How to block the traffic. Use a action from man 5 ipfw
#          Common values: deny, unreach port, reset
# Values:  STRING
#
blocktype = deny


# Option:  rulenumber
# Notes.:  Number of set of rules.  IPFW can manipulate some rules on the same number rule
#          Common values: 10000
# Values:  NUM
#
rulenumber = 10000

# Option:  numberofrules
# Notes.:  Numbers of rules.  IPFW can manipulate some rules on
#               the same rule number , but when unban action the 
#               ipfw will delete all rules with same number.  
#               With numberofrules we can define a set of rules 
#               ipfw can use.
#          Common values: 20000
# Values:  NUM
#
numberofrules = 20000


# Option:  proto
# Notes.:  Name of protocoll under rule
#          Common values: tcp, udp, all, ip
#				see ipfw man page
# Values:  STRING
#
proto = ip   



# Option:  nic
# Notes.:  Name of network inteface, see /etc/rc.conf
#          Common values: em0, re0, ....
#				see /usr/src/sys/{ARCH}/conf/LINT for all nic names
# Values:  STRING
