# /etc/fail2ban/action.d/blacklist.conf
# Fail2Ban Blacklist for Repeat Offenders (action.d)
#
# Author: Mitchell Krog <mitchellkrog@gmail.com>
# Version: 1.0
# Tested On: Fail2Ban 0.91
# Server: Ubuntu 16.04
# Firewall: IPTables
#
# Dependancies: requires blacklist.conf in /etc/fail2ban/filter.d folder
#               requires jail settings called [blacklist]
#				requires ip.blacklist file in /etc/fail2ban
#				create with sudo touch /etc/fail2ban/ip.blacklist
#
# Drawbacks: Only works with IPTables
#
# Based on: the Recidive Jail from Fail2Ban
#
# This custom action requires a custom jail in your 
# jail.local file for Fail2Ban
# 
# Your jail file would be configured as follows
#
# [blacklist]
# enabled = true
# logpath  = /var/log/fail2ban.*
# banaction = blacklist
# bantime  = 31536000   ; 1 year
# findtime = 31536000   ; 1 year
# maxretry = 10
#
