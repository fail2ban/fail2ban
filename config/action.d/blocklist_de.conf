# Action to report IP address to blocklist.de
# Blocklist.de must be signed up to at www.blocklist.de
# Once registered, one or more servers can be added.
# This action requires the server 'email address' and the associated apikey.
#
# From blocklist.de:
#   www.blocklist.de is a free and voluntary service provided by a
#   Fraud/Abuse-specialist, whose servers are often attacked on SSH-,
#   Mail-Login-, FTP-, Webserver- and other services.
#   The mission is to report all attacks to the abuse departments of the
#   infected PCs/servers to ensure that the responsible provider can inform
#   the customer about the infection and disable them
#
# IMPORTANT: 
# 
# Reporting an IP of abuse is a serious complaint. Make sure that it is
# serious. Fail2ban developers and network owners recommend you only use this
# action for:
#   * The recidive where the IP has been banned multiple times
#   * Where maxretry has been set quite high, beyond the normal user typing
#     password incorrectly.
#   * For filters that have a low likelihood of receiving human errors
#
