# Option:  actionban
# Notes.:  command executed when banning an IP. Take care that the

[Init]
# Option:  table
# Notes:   The ipfw table to use. If a ipfw rule using this table already exists,
#          this action will not create a ipfw rule to block it and the following
#          options will have no effect.
# Values:  NUM
table = 1

# Option:  port
# Notes.:  Specifies port to monitor. Blank indicate block all ports.
# Values:  [ NUM | STRING ]
#
port = 

# Option:  startstatefile
# Notes:   A file to indicate that the table rule that was added. Ensure it is unique per table.
# Values:  STRING
startstatefile = /var/run/fail2ban/ipfw-started-table_<table>

# Option:  action
# Notes:   This is the action to take for automaticly created rules. See the 
#          ACTION defination at the top of man ipfw for allowed values.
#          "deny" and "unreach port" are probably the useful.
# Values:  STRING
action = deny

# Option: block
# Notes:  This is how much to block.
#         Can be "ip", "tcp", "udp" or various other options.
# Values: STRING
block = ip
