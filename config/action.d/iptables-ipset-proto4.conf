# Fail2Ban configuration file
#
# Author: Daniel Black
#
# This is for ipset protocol 4 (ipset v4.2). If you have a later version
# of ipset try to use the iptables-ipset-proto6.conf as it does some things
# nicer.
# 
# This requires the program ipset which is normally in package called ipset.
#
# IPset was a feature introduced in the linux kernel 2.6.39 and 3.0.0 kernels.
#
# If you are running on an older kernel you make need to patch in external
# modules.
#
# On Debian machines this can be done with:
#
# apt-get install ipset xtables-addons-source 
# module-assistant auto-install xtables-addons
