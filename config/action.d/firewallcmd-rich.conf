# Because of the rich rule commands requires firewalld-0.3.1+
# This action uses firewalld rich-rules which gives you a cleaner iptables since it stores rules according to zones and not
# by chain. So for an example all deny rules will be listed under <zone>_deny and all log rules under <zone>_log. 
#
# Also this action can log banned access attempts so that you can filter those logs and increase ban time for offenders.
#
# If you use the --permanent rule you get a xml file in /etc/firewalld/zones/<zone>.xml that can be shared and parsed easliy
#
# Example commands to view rules:
# firewall-cmd [--zone=<zone>] --list-rich-rules
# firewall-cmd [--zone=<zone>] --list-all
# firewall-cmd [--zone=zone] --query-rich-rule='rule'

# you can also use zones and/or service names. 
#
# zone example: 
# firewall-cmd --zone=<zone> --add-rich-rule="rule family='<family>' source address='<ip>' port port='<port>' protocol='<protocol>' log prefix='f2b-<name>' level='<level>' limit value='<rate>/m' <rich-blocktype>"
#
# service name example:
# firewall-cmd --zone=<zone> --add-rich-rule="rule family='<family>' source address='<ip>' service name='<service>' log prefix='f2b-<name>' level='<level>' limit value='<rate>/m' <rich-blocktype>"
#
# Because rich rules can only handle single or a range of ports we must split ports and execute the command for each port. Ports can be single and ranges seperated by a comma or space for an example: http, https, 22-60, 18 smtp
