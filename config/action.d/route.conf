# Fail2Ban configuration file
#
# Author: Michael Gebetsroither
#
# This is for blocking whole hosts through blackhole routes.
#
# PRO:
#   - Works on all kernel versions and as no compatibility problems (back to debian lenny and WAY further).
#   - It's FAST for very large numbers of blocked ips.
#   - It's FAST because it Blocks traffic before it enters common iptables chains used for filtering.
#   - It's per host, ideal as action against ssh password bruteforcing to block further attack attempts.
#   - No additional software required beside iproute/iproute2
#
# CON:
#   - Blocking is per IP and NOT per service, but ideal as action against ssh password bruteforcing hosts

[Definition]
actionban   = ip route add <type> <ip4>
              ip -6 route add <type> <ip6prefix> dev <device>

actionunban = ip route del <type> <ip4>
              ip -6 route del <type> <ip6prefix> dev <device>

# Type of blocking
#
# Type can be blackhole, unreachable and prohibit. Unreachable and prohibit correspond to the ICMP reject messages.

type = blackhole

# Device
#
# Device is manditory for IPv6 route blocks
device = eth0
