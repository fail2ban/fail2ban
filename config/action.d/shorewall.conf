# Fail2Ban configuration file

# The default Shorewall configuration is with "BLACKLISTNEWONLY=Yes" (see
# file /etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf). This means that when Fail2ban adds a
# new shorewall rule to ban an IP address, that rule will affect only new
# connections. So if the attempter goes on trying using the same connection
# he could even log in. In order to get the same behavior of the iptable
# action (so that the ban is immediate) the /etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf
# file should me modified with "BLACKLISTNEWONLY=No".
