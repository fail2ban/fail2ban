# Fail2Ban configuration file
#
# Author: Andrew St. Jean
#
# Use nsupdate to perform dynamic DNS updates on a BIND zone file.
# One may want to do this to update a local RBL with banned IP addresses.
#
# Options
#
# domain	DNS domain that will appear in nsupdate add and delete
#		commands.
#
# ttl		The time to live (TTL) in seconds of the TXT resource
#		record.
#
# rdata		Data portion of the TXT resource record.
#
# nsupdatecmd	Full path to the nsupdate command.
#
# keyfile	Full path to TSIG key file used for authentication between
#		nsupdate and BIND.
#
# Create an nsupdate.local to set at least the <domain> and <keyfile>
# options as they don't have default values.
#
# The ban and unban commands assume nsupdate will authenticate to the BIND
# server using a TSIG key. The full path to the key file must be specified
# in the <keyfile> parameter. Use this command to generate your TSIG key.
#
# dnssec-keygen -a HMAC-MD5 -b 256 -n HOST <key_name>
#
# Replace <key_name> with some meaningful name.
#
# This command will generate two files. Specify the .private file in the
# <keyfile> option. Note that the .key file must also be present in the same
# directory for nsupdate to use the key.
#
# Don't forget to add the key and appropriate allow-update or update-policy
# option to your named.conf file.
