# Fail2Ban configuration file
#
# Author: Eduardo Diaz
#
# This is for ipset protocol 6 (and hopefully later) (ipset v6.14).
# for shorewall
#
# Use this setting in jail.conf to modify use this action instead of a
# default one
#
# banaction   = shorewall-ipset-proto6
#
# This requires the program ipset which is normally in package called ipset.
#
# IPset was a feature introduced in the linux kernel 2.6.39 and 3.0.0
# kernels, and you need Shorewall >= 4.5.5 to use this action.
#
# The default Shorewall configuration is with "BLACKLISTNEWONLY=Yes" (see
# file /etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf). This means that when Fail2ban adds a
# new shorewall rule to ban an IP address, that rule will affect only new
# connections. So if the attacker goes on trying using the same connection
# he could even log in. In order to get the same behavior of the iptable
# action (so that the ban is immediate) the /etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf
# file should me modified with "BLACKLISTNEWONLY=No".
#
#
# Enable shorewall to use a blacklist using iptables creating a file
# /etc/shorewall/blrules and adding "DROP net:+f2b-ssh all" and
# similar lines for every jail.  To enable restoring you ipset you
# must set SAVE_IPSETS=Yes in shorewall.conf .  You can read more
# about ipsets handling in Shorewall at http://shorewall.net/ipsets.html
#
# To force creation of the ipset in the case that somebody deletes the
# ipset create a file /etc/shorewall/initdone and add one line for
# every ipset (this files are in Perl) and add 1 at the end of the file.
# The example:
# system("/usr/sbin/ipset -quiet -exist create f2b-ssh hash:ip timeout 600 ");
# 1;
#
# To destroy the ipset in shorewall you must add to the file /etc/shorewall/stopped
# # One line of every ipset
# system("/usr/sbin/ipset -quiet destroy f2b-ssh ");
# 1; # This must go to the end of the file if not shorewall compilation fails
#


[Definition]

# Option:  actionstart
# Notes.:  command executed on demand at the first ban (or at the start of Fail2Ban if actionstart_on_demand is set to false).
# Values:  CMD
#
actionstart = if ! ipset -quiet -name list f2b-<name> >/dev/null;
              then ipset -quiet -exist create f2b-<name> hash:ip timeout <bantime>;
              fi

# Option:  actionstop
# Notes.:  command executed at the stop of jail (or at the end of Fail2Ban)
# Values:  CMD
#
actionstop = ipset flush f2b-<name>

# Option:  actionban
# Notes.:  command executed when banning an IP. Take care that the
#          command is executed with Fail2Ban user rights.
# Tags:    See jail.conf(5) man page
# Values:  CMD
#
actionban = ipset add f2b-<name> <ip> timeout <bantime> -exist

# Option:  actionunban
# Notes.:  command executed when unbanning an IP. Take care that the
#          command is executed with Fail2Ban user rights.
# Tags:    See jail.conf(5) man page
# Values:  CMD
#
actionunban = ipset del f2b-<name> <ip> -exist

[Init]

# Option: bantime
# Notes:  specifies the bantime in seconds (handled internally rather than by fail2ban)
# Values:  [ NUM ]  Default: 600
#
bantime = 600
