# Option:  actionstart
# Notes.:  command executed once at the start of Fail2Ban.
# Values:  CMD
#
# Changing iptables rules requires root privileges. If fail2ban is
# configured to run as root, firewall setup can be performed by
# fail2ban automatically. However, if fail2ban is configured to run as
# a normal user, the configuration must be done by some other means
# (e.g. using static firewall configuration with the
# iptables-persistent package).
# 
# Explanation of the rule below:
#    Check if any packets coming from an IP on the <iptname>
#    list have been seen in the last 3600 seconds. If yes, update the
#    timestamp for this IP and drop the packet. If not, let the packet
#    through.
#
#    Fail2ban inserts blacklisted hosts into the <iptname> list
#    and removes them from the list after some time, according to its
#    own rules. The 3600 second timeout is independent and acts as a
#    safeguard in case the fail2ban process dies unexpectedly. The
#    shorter of the two timeouts actually matters.
actionstart = if [ `id -u` -eq 0 ];then <iptables> -I <chain> -m recent --update --seconds 3600 --name <iptname> -j <blocktype>;fi

# Option:  actioncheck
# Notes.:  command executed once before each actionban command
# Values:  CMD
#
actioncheck = test -e /proc/net/xt_recent/<iptname>

# Option:  actionban
# Notes.:  command executed when banning an IP. Take care that the
#          command is executed with Fail2Ban user rights.
# Tags:    See jail.conf(5) man page
# Values:  CMD

actionban = echo +<ip> > /proc/net/xt_recent/<iptname>

# Option:  actionunban
# Notes.:  command executed when unbanning an IP. Take care that the
#          command is executed with Fail2Ban user rights.
# Tags:    See jail.conf(5) man page
# Values:  CMD
