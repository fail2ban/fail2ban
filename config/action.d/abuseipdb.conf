# Fail2ban configuration file
#
# Action to report IP address to abuseipdb.com
# You must sign up to obtain an API key from abuseipdb.com.
#
# NOTE: These reports may include sensitive Info.
# If you want cleaner reports that ensure no user data see the helper script at the below website.
#
# IMPORTANT:
#
# Reporting an IP of abuse is a serious complaint. Make sure that it is
# serious. Fail2ban developers and network owners recommend you only use this
# action for:
#   * The recidive where the IP has been banned multiple times
#   * Where maxretry has been set quite high, beyond the normal user typing
#     password incorrectly.
#   * For filters that have a low likelihood of receiving human errors
#
# This action relies on a api_key being added to the above action conf,
# and the appropriate categories set.
#
# Example, for ssh bruteforce (in section [sshd] of `jail.local`): 
#   action = %(known/action)s
#            %(action_abuseipdb)s[abuseipdb_apikey="my-api-key", abuseipdb_category="18,22"]
#
# See below for catagories.

## abuseIPDB Catagories, `the abuseipdb_category` MUST be set in the jail.conf action call.

#          By default, this posts directly to AbuseIPDB's API, unfortunately
#          this results in a lot of backslashes/escapes appearing in the
#          reports. This also may include info like your hostname.
#          If you have your own web server with PHP available, you can
#          use my (Shaun's) helper PHP script by commenting out the first #actionban
#          line below, uncommenting the second one, and pointing the URL at
#          wherever you install the helper script. For the PHP helper script, see
#          <https://wiki.shaunc.com/wikka.php?wakka=ReportingToAbuseIPDBWithFail2Ban>

#          --ciphers ecdhe_ecdsa_aes_256_sha is used to workaround a
