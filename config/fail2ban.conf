# Fail2Ban main configuration file
#
# Comments: use '#' for comment lines and ';' (following a space) for inline comments
#
# Changes:  in most of the cases you should not modify this
#           file, but provide customizations in fail2ban.local file, e.g.:
#
# [Definition]
# loglevel = DEBUG
#

[Definition]

# Option: loglevel
# Notes.: Set the log level output.
#         CRITICAL
#         ERROR
#         WARNING
#         NOTICE
#         INFO
#         DEBUG
# Values: [ LEVEL ]  Default: ERROR
#
loglevel = INFO

# Option: logtarget
# Notes.: Set the log target. This could be a file, SYSLOG, STDERR or STDOUT.
#         Only one log target can be specified.
#         If you change logtarget from the default value and you are
#         using logrotate -- also adjust or disable rotation in the
#         corresponding configuration file
#         (e.g. /etc/logrotate.d/fail2ban on Debian systems)
# Values: [ STDOUT | STDERR | SYSLOG | SYSOUT | FILE ]  Default: STDERR
#
logtarget = /var/log/fail2ban.log

# Option: syslogsocket
# Notes: Set the syslog socket file. Only used when logtarget is SYSLOG
#        auto uses platform.system() to determine predefined paths
# Values: [ auto | FILE ]  Default: auto
syslogsocket = auto

# Option: socket
# Notes.: Set the socket file. This is used to communicate with the daemon. Do
#         not remove this file when Fail2ban runs. It will not be possible to
#         communicate with the server afterwards.
# Values: [ FILE ]  Default: /var/run/fail2ban/fail2ban.sock
#
socket = /var/run/fail2ban/fail2ban.sock

# Option: pidfile
# Notes.: Set the PID file. This is used to store the process ID of the
#         fail2ban server.
# Values: [ FILE ]  Default: /var/run/fail2ban/fail2ban.pid
#
pidfile = /var/run/fail2ban/fail2ban.pid

# Options: dbfile
# Notes.: Set the file for the fail2ban persistent data to be stored.
#         A value of ":memory:" means database is only stored in memory 
#         and data is lost when fail2ban is stopped.
#         A value of "None" disables the database.
# Values: [ None :memory: FILE ] Default: /var/lib/fail2ban/fail2ban.sqlite3
dbfile = /var/lib/fail2ban/fail2ban.sqlite3

# Options: dbpurgeage
# Notes.: Sets age at which bans should be purged from the database
# Values: [ SECONDS ] Default: 86400 (24hours)
dbpurgeage = 1d
