.SH NAME
fail2ban-python \- a helper for Fail2Ban to assure that the same Python is used
.SH DESCRIPTION
usage: fail2ban\-python [option] ... [\-c cmd | \fB\-m\fR mod | file | \fB\-]\fR [arg] ...
Options and arguments (and corresponding environment variables):
\fB\-B\fR     : don't write .py[co] files on import; also PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=x
\fB\-c\fR cmd : program passed in as string (terminates option list)
\fB\-d\fR     : debug output from parser; also PYTHONDEBUG=x
\fB\-E\fR     : ignore PYTHON* environment variables (such as PYTHONPATH)
\fB\-h\fR     : print this help message and exit (also \fB\-\-help\fR)
\fB\-i\fR     : inspect interactively after running script; forces a prompt even
.IP
if stdin does not appear to be a terminal; also PYTHONINSPECT=x
.PP
\fB\-m\fR mod : run library module as a script (terminates option list)
\fB\-O\fR     : optimize generated bytecode slightly; also PYTHONOPTIMIZE=x
\fB\-OO\fR    : remove doc\-strings in addition to the \fB\-O\fR optimizations
\fB\-R\fR     : use a pseudo\-random salt to make hash() values of various types be
.IP
unpredictable between separate invocations of the interpreter, as
a defense against denial\-of\-service attacks
.PP
\fB\-Q\fR arg : division options: \fB\-Qold\fR (default), \fB\-Qwarn\fR, \fB\-Qwarnall\fR, \fB\-Qnew\fR
\fB\-s\fR     : don't add user site directory to sys.path; also PYTHONNOUSERSITE
\fB\-S\fR     : don't imply 'import site' on initialization
\fB\-t\fR     : issue warnings about inconsistent tab usage (\fB\-tt\fR: issue errors)
\fB\-u\fR     : unbuffered binary stdout and stderr; also PYTHONUNBUFFERED=x
.IP
see man page for details on internal buffering relating to '\-u'
.PP
\fB\-v\fR     : verbose (trace import statements); also PYTHONVERBOSE=x
.IP
can be supplied multiple times to increase verbosity
.PP
\fB\-V\fR     : print the Python version number and exit (also \fB\-\-version\fR)
\fB\-W\fR arg : warning control; arg is action:message:category:module:lineno
.IP
also PYTHONWARNINGS=arg
.PP
\fB\-x\fR     : skip first line of source, allowing use of non\-Unix forms of #!cmd
\fB\-3\fR     : warn about Python 3.x incompatibilities that 2to3 cannot trivially fix
file   : program read from script file
\-      : program read from stdin (default; interactive mode if a tty)
arg ...: arguments passed to program in sys.argv[1:]
.PP
Other environment variables:
PYTHONSTARTUP: file executed on interactive startup (no default)
PYTHONPATH   : ':'\-separated list of directories prefixed to the
.TP
default module search path.
The result is sys.path.
.PP
PYTHONHOME   : alternate <prefix> directory (or <prefix>:<exec_prefix>).
.IP
The default module search path uses <prefix>/pythonX.X.
.PP
PYTHONCASEOK : ignore case in 'import' statements (Windows).
PYTHONIOENCODING: Encoding[:errors] used for stdin/stdout/stderr.
PYTHONHASHSEED: if this variable is set to 'random', the effect is the same
.IP
as specifying the \fB\-R\fR option: a random value is used to seed the hashes of
str, bytes and datetime objects.  It can also be set to an integer
in the range [0,4294967295] to get hash values with a predictable seed.
