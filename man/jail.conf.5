.TH JAIL.CONF "5" "March 2013" "Fail2Ban" "Fail2Ban Configuration"
.SH NAME
jail.conf \- configuration for the fail2ban server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.I jail.conf / jail.local

.I action.d/*.conf action.d/*.local

.I filter.d/*.conf filter.d/*.local
.SH DESCRIPTION
Fail2ban has three configuration file types. Action files are the commands for banning and unbanning of IP address,
Filter files tell fail2ban how to detect authentication failures, and Jail configurations combine filters with actions into jails.

There are *.conf files that are distributed by fail2ban and *.local file that contain user customizations.
It is recommended that *.conf files should remain unchanged.  If needed, customizations should be provided in *.local files.
For instance, if you would like to customize the [ssh-iptables-ipset] jail, create a jail.local to extend jail.conf
(the configuration for the fail2ban server).  The jail.local file will be the following if you only need to enable
it:

.TP
\fIjail.local\fR
[ssh-iptables-ipset]

enabled = true

.PP
Override only the settings you need to change and the rest of the configuration will come from the corresponding
*.conf file.

\fI*.d/\fR
.RS
In addition to .local, for any .conf file there can be a corresponding
\fI.d/\fR directory to contain additional .conf files that will be read after the
appropriate .local file.  Last parsed file will take precidence over
identical entries, parsed alphabetically, e.g.

.RS
\fIjail.d/01_enable.conf\fR - to enable a specific jail
.RE
.RS
\fIjail.d/02_custom_port.conf\fR - containing specific configuration entry to change the port of the jail specified in the configuration
.RE
.RS
\fIfail2ban.d/01_custom_log.conf\fR - containing specific configuration entry to use a different log path.
.RE
.RE

.SH DEFAULT
The following options are applicable to all jails. Their meaning is described in the default \fIjail.conf\fR file.
.TP
\fBignoreip\fR 
.TP
\fBbantime\fR
.TP
\fBfindtime\fR
.TP
\fBmaxretry\fR
.TP
\fBbackend\fR
.TP
\fBusedns\fR


.SH "ACTION FILES"
Action files specify which commands are executed to ban and unban an IP address. They are located under \fI/etc/fail2ban/action.d\fR.

Like with jail.conf files, if you desire local changes create an \fI[actionname].local\fR file in the \fI/etc/fail2ban/action.d\fR directory
and override the required settings.

Action files are ini files that have two sections, \fBDefinition\fR and \fBInit\fR . 

The [Init] section allows for action-specific settings. In \fIjail.conf/jail.local\fR these can be overwritten for a particular jail as options to the jail.

The following commands can be present in the [Definition] section.
.TP
\fBactionstart\fR
command(s) executed when the jail starts.
.TP
\fBactionstop\fR
command(s) executed when the jail stops.
.TP
\fBactioncheck\fR
the command ran before any other action. It aims to verify if the environment is still ok.
.TP
\fBactionban\fR
command(s) that bans the IP address after \fBmaxretry\fR log lines matches within last \fBfindtime\fR seconds.
.TP
\fBactionunban\fR
command(s) that unbans the IP address after \fBbantime\fR.

Commands specified in the [Definition] section are executed through a system shell so shell redirection and process control is allowed. The commands should
return 0, otherwise error would be logged.  Moreover if \fBactioncheck\fR exits with non-0 status, it is taken as indication that firewall status has changed and fail2ban needs to reinitialize itself (i.e. issue \fBactionstop\fR and \fBactionstart\fR commands).

Tags are enclosed in <>.  All the elements of [Init] are tags that are replaced in all action commands.  Tags can be added by the
\fBfail2ban-client\fR using the setctag command.

More than a single command is allowed to be specified. Each command needs to be on a separate line and indented with whitespaces without blank lines. The following example defines
two commands to be executed.

 actionban = iptables -I fail2ban-<name> --source <ip> -j DROP
             echo ip=<ip>, match=<match>, time=<time> >> /var/log/fail2ban.log

.SS "Action Tags"
The following tags are substituted in the actionban, actionunban and actioncheck (when called before actionban/actionunban) commands.
.TP
\fBip\fR
An IPv4 ip address to be banned. e.g. 192.168.0.2
.TP
\fBfailures\fR
The number of times the failure occurred in the log file. e.g. 3
.TP
\fBtime\fR
The unix time of the ban. e.g. 1357508484
.TP
\fBmatches\fR
The concatenated string of the log file lines of the matches that generated the ban. Many characters interpreted by shell get escaped.

.SH FILTER FILES

Filter definitions are those in \fI/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/*.conf\fR and \fIfilter.d/*.local\fR.

These are used to identify failed authentication attempts in logs and to extract the host IP address (or hostname if \fBusedns\fR is \fBtrue\fR).

Like action files, filter files are ini files. The main section is the [Definition] section.

There are two filter definitions used in the [Definition] section:

.TP
\fBfailregex\fR
is the regex (\fBreg\fRular \fBex\fRpression) that will match failed attempts. The tag <HOST> is used as part of the regex and is itself a regex
for IPv4 addresses and hostnames. fail2ban will work out which one of these it actually is.

.TP
\fBignoreregex\fR
is the regex to identify log entries that should be ignored by fail2ban, even if they match failregex.


Using Python "string interpolation" mechanisms, other definitions are allowed and can later be used within other definitions as %(defnname)s. For example.

 baduseragents = IE|wget
 failregex = useragent=%(baduseragents)s

.PP
Filters can also have a section called [INCLUDES]. This is used to read other configuration files.

.TP
\fBbefore\fR
indicates that this file is read before the [Definition] section.

.TP
\fBafter\fR
indicates that this file is read after the [Definition] section.
