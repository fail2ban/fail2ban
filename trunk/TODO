ToDo                                         $Revision$
=============================================================

Legend:
- not yet done
? maybe
# partially done
* done

- correct handling of threads (join???)

- signal handling (ctrl-c, etc)

- add a reload option to fail2ban-client

- see Feature Request Tracking System at SourceForge.net

* findall in dns.py should be no more needed

* remove utils/ directory

- improve installation process (better prefix support)

# improve documentation and website for user

* use Doxygen

- use PyLint to check the code

* better configuration files

- add a check to see if the time of the log messages is
  correctly detected (valid regexp)

? use Gentoo Portage style for scripts.
  - banning engines script in /etc/fail2ban/scripts.d
    Example: /etc/fail2ban/scripts.d/iptables
    Will be mostly bash scripting which is more "user
    friendly".
  - split configuration files in /etc/fail2ban/services.d
    for log files
    Example: /etc/fail2ban/services.d/apache
    Mainly regular expressions.
  - template for common regex in /etc/fail2ban/templates.d
    Example: /etc/fail2ban/templates.d/date
    Mainly regular expressions.

* remove debug mode (root check)

# better return values in function

? use more email.Utils in mail.py

? add gettext support. Is this really needed for a server
  utility?

* send an email when fail2ban is running

* add multithreading. Python threading is not really
  efficient. However, fail2ban could benefit of it. We could
  use threads like this:
  - one thread which check for host to unban.
  - one thread per file to watch. This will allow things like
    different polling time for each file.
  <srv> is read-only (we only read log files) thus no locks
  are required. However, <meth> is read-write and must take
  care of concurrency in case of multithreading.

- add FAM/Gamin support. Should be quite efficient with
  threading. Take care that handle_one_event() release the
  Python lock.

# add a test framework. We could use unittest which is in
  Python since 2.1. It should be possible to run all tests
  automatically.

* add client/server using socket. Something similar to
  gdesklets. DBUS seems to be designed for desktop use.
  - fail2ban start -> start the daemon.
  - fail2ban stop -> stop the daemon.
  - fail2ban add <srv> <meth> -> add <srv> monitoring with
    <meth> ban method (iptables, hosts.deny, etc).
  - fail2ban del <srv> -> remove <srv> monitoring.
  - fail2ban status <srv> -> query current fail2ban status.
    Should return infos like a ban counter. Could be graph
    with rrdtool.
  - fail2ban pause <srv> -> suspend monitoring.
  - fail2ban resume <srv> -> resume monitoring.
  - fail2ban list -> list available services.
  - fail2ban flush <srv> -> flush the <srv> ban list.
  
* remove PID file.

* remove most of the command lines options if possible.

- add the possibility to specify wildcard in log files.
  Example: logfile = /var/log/apache2/access-*.log
  Should we start one thread per file or just one thread per
  serivce?

- autodetect date format in log file. Match the most popular
  format and sort them using the hit ratio. Should avoid
  user problem with regex and not have a big impact on perfs.

- restart automatically the daemon if an exception occurs.

- do not close socket after a send

- refactoring in server.py, actions.py, filter.py
