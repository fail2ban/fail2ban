  startup of fail2ban, fail2ban will do "maxreinit" attempts to initialize its
  own firewall. It will sleep between attempts for "polltime" number of seconds
  (closes Debian: #334272). Thanks to Yaroslav Halchenko
- Added "interpolations" in fail2ban.conf. This is provided by the ConfigParser
  module. Old configuration files still work. Thanks to Yaroslav Halchenko

    further adjusted by upstream author).
  * Added -f command line parameter for [findtime].
  * Added a cleanup of firewall rules on emergency shutdown when unknown
    exception is catched.
  * Fail2ban should not crash now if a wrong file name is specified in config.
  * reordered code a bit so that log targets are setup right after background
    and then only loglevel (verbose, debug) is processed, so the warning could
    be seen in the logs
  * Added a keyword <section> in parsing of the subject and the body of an email
    sent out by fail2ban (closes: #330311)

ver. 0.5.4 (2005/09/13) - beta
----------
