Fail2Ban (version 0.8.10)                                             2013/06/12
================================================================================

ver. 0.8.11 (2013/XX/XXX) - loves-unittests
-----------

- Fixes:
  Daniel Black & Marcel Dopita
   * filter.d/apache-auth -- fixed and apache auth samples provide. closes #286
  Yaroslav Halchenko
   * filter.d/common.conf -- make colon after [daemon] optional. Closes gh-267
   * filter.d/apache-common.conf -- support apache 2.4 more detailed error
     log format.  Closes gh-268
   * Backends changes detection and parsing. Close gh-223 and gh-103:
     - Polling backend: detect changes in the files not only based on
       mtime, but also on the size and inode.  It should allow for
       better detection of changes and log rotations on busy servers,
       older python 2.4, and file systems with precision of mtime only
       up to a second (e.g. ext3).
     - All backends, possible race condition: do not read from a file
       initially reported empty.  Originally could have lead to
       accounting for detected log lines multiple times.
     - Do not crash if executing a command in fail2ban-client interactive
       mode has failed (e.g. due to incorrect syntax). Closes gh-353
  Daniel Black & Мернов Георгий
   * filter.d/dovecot.conf -- Fix when no TLS enabled - line doesn't end in ,
  Daniel Black
   * action.d/hostsdeny -- NOTE: new dependancy 'ed'. Switched to use 'ed' across
     all platforms to ensure permissions are the same before and after a ban -
     closes gh-266. hostsdeny supports daemon_list now too.
   * filter.d/roundcube-auth - timezone offset can be positive or negative
   * action.d/bsd-ipfw - action option unsed. Fixed to blocktype for
     consistency. default to port unreach instead of deny
  Rolf Fokkens
   * action.d/dshield.conf and complain.conf -- reorder mailx arguments.
     https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=998020
  John Doe (ache)
   * action.d/bsd-ipfw.conf - invert actionstop logic to make exist status 0.
     closes gh-343.
  JP Espinosa (Reviewed by O.Poplawski)

     avoiding problems with getpid.  Also $network and iptables moved
     to Should- rc init fields

     mod_auth_digest failures.
   * filter.d/recidive -- support f2b syslog target and anchor regex at start
   * filter.d/pam-generic - added syslog prefix. Disabled support for
     linux-pam before version 0.99.2.0 (2005)

  own firewall. It will sleep between attempts for "polltime" number of seconds
  (closes Debian: #334272). Thanks to Yaroslav Halchenko
- Added "interpolations" in fail2ban.conf. This is provided by the ConfigParser
  module. Old configuration files still work. Thanks to Yaroslav Halchenko

  * Added a cleanup of firewall rules on emergency shutdown when unknown
    exception is catched.
  * Fail2ban should not crash now if a wrong file name is specified in config.
  * reordered code a bit so that log targets are setup right after background
    and then only loglevel (verbose, debug) is processed, so the warning could
    be seen in the logs
  * Added a keyword <section> in parsing of the subject and the body of an email
    sent out by fail2ban (closes: #330311)
