Fail2Ban: Changelog
===================

ver. 0.9.4 (2016/03/08) - for-you-ladies
-----------

- Fixes:
   * roundcube-auth jail typo for logpath
   * Fix dnsToIp resolver for fqdn with large list of IPs (gh-1164)
   * filter.d/apache-badbots.conf
     - Updated useragent string regex adding escape for `+`
   * filter.d/mysqld-auth.conf
     - Updated "Access denied ..." regex for MySQL 5.6 and later (gh-1211, gh-1332)
   * filter.d/sshd.conf
     - Updated "Auth fail" regex for OpenSSH 5.9 and later
   * Treat failed and killed execution of commands identically (only
     different log messages), which addresses different behavior on different
     exit codes of dash and bash (gh-1155)
   * Fix jail.conf.5 man's section (gh-1226)
   * Fixed default banaction for allports jails like pam-generic, recidive, etc
     with new default variable `banaction_allports` (gh-1216)
   * Fixed `fail2ban-regex` stops working on invalid (wrong encoded) character
     for python version < 3.x (gh-1248)
   * Use postfix_log logpath for postfix-rbl jail
   * filters.d/postfix.conf - add 'Sender address rejected: Domain not found' failregex
   * use `fail2ban_agent` as user-agent in actions badips, blocklist_de, etc (gh-1271)
   * Fix ignoring the sender option by action_mw, action_mwl and action_c_mwl
   * Changed filter.d/asterisk regex for "Call from ..." (few vulnerable now)
   * Removed compression and rotation count from logrotate (inherit them from
     the global logrotate config)

- New Features:
   * New interpolation feature for definition config readers - `<known/parameter>`
     (means last known init definition of filters or actions with name `parameter`).
     This interpolation makes possible to extend a parameters of stock filter or 
     action directly in jail inside jail.local file, without creating a separately
     filter.d/*.local file.
     As extension to interpolation `%(known/parameter)s`, that does not works for
     filter and action init parameters
   * New actions:
     - nftables-multiport and nftables-allports - filtering using nftables
       framework. Note: it requires a pre-existing chain for the filtering rule.
   * New filters:
     - openhab - domotic software authentication failure with the
       rest api and web interface (gh-1223)
     - nginx-limit-req - ban hosts, that were failed through nginx by limit
       request processing rate (ngx_http_limit_req_module)
     - murmur - ban hosts that repeatedly attempt to connect to
       murmur/mumble-server with an invalid server password or certificate.
     - haproxy-http-auth - filter to match failed HTTP Authentications against a
       HAProxy server
   * New jails:
     - murmur - bans TCP and UDP from the bad host on the default murmur port.
   * sshd filter got new failregex to match "maximum authentication
     attempts exceeded" (introduced in openssh 6.8)
   * Added filter for Mac OS screen sharing (VNC) daemon

- Enhancements:
   * Do not rotate empty log files
   * Added new date pattern with year after day (e.g. Sun Jan 23 2005 21:59:59)
     http://bugs.debian.org/798923
   * Added openSUSE path configuration (Thanks Johannes Weberhofer)
   * Allow to split ignoreip entries by ',' as well as by ' ' (gh-1197)
   * Added a timeout (3 sec) to urlopen within badips.py action
     (Thanks M. Maraun)
   * Added check against atacker's Googlebot PTR fake records
     (Thanks Pablo Rodriguez Fernandez)
   * Enhance filter against atacker's Googlebot PTR fake records
     (gh-1226)
   * Nginx log paths extended (prefixed with "*" wildcard) (gh-1237)
   * Added filter for openhab domotic software authentication failure with the
     rest api and web interface (gh-1223)
   * Add *_backend options for services to allow distros to set the default
     backend per service, set default to systemd for Fedora as appropriate
   * Performance improvements while monitoring large number of files (gh-1265).
     Use associative array (dict) for monitored log files to speed up lookup 
     operations. Thanks @kshetragia
   * Specified that fail2ban is PartOf iptables.service firewalld.service in
     .service file -- would reload fail2ban if those services are restarted
   * Provides new default `fail2ban_version` and interpolation variable
     `fail2ban_agent` in jail.conf
   * Enhance filter 'postfix' to ban incoming SMTP client with no fqdn hostname,
     and to support multiple instances of postfix having varying suffix (gh-1331)
     (Thanks Tom Hendrikx)
   * files/gentoo-initd to use start-stop-daemon to robustify restarting the service


ver. 0.9.3 (2015/08/01) - lets-all-stay-friends
----------

- IMPORTANT incompatible changes:
   * filter.d/roundcube-auth.conf
     - Changed logpath to 'errors' log (was 'userlogins')
   * action.d/iptables-common.conf
     - All calls to iptables command now use -w switch introduced in
       iptables 1.4.20 (some distribution could have patched their
       earlier base version as well) to provide this locking mechanism
       useful under heavy load to avoid contesting on iptables calls.
       If you need to disable, define 'action.d/iptables-common.local'
       with empty value for 'lockingopt' in `[Init]` section.
   * mail-whois-lines, sendmail-geoip-lines and sendmail-whois-lines
     actions now include by default only the first 1000 log lines in
     the emails.  Adjust <grepopts> to augment the behavior.

- Fixes:
   * reload in interactive mode appends all the jails twice (gh-825)
   * reload server/jail failed if database used (but was not changed) and
     some jail active (gh-1072)
   * filter.d/dovecot.conf - also match unknown user in passwd-file.
     Thanks Anton Shestakov
   * Fix fail2ban-regex not parsing journalmatch correctly from filter config
   * filter.d/asterisk.conf - fix security log support for Asterisk 12+
   * filter.d/roundcube-auth.conf
     - Updated regex to work with 'errors' log (1.0.5 and 1.1.1)
     - Added regex to work with 'userlogins' log
   * action.d/sendmail*.conf - use LC_ALL (superseeding LC_TIME) to override
     locale on systems with customized LC_ALL
   * performance fix: minimizes connection overhead, close socket only at
     communication end (gh-1099)
   * unbanip always deletes ip from database (independent of bantime, also if
     currently not banned or persistent)
   * guarantee order of dbfile to be before dbpurgeage (gh-1048)
   * always set 'dbfile' before other database options (gh-1050)
   * kill the entire process group of the child process upon timeout (gh-1129).
     Otherwise could lead to resource exhaustion due to hanging whois
     processes.
   * resolve /var/run/fail2ban path in setup.py to help installation
     on platforms with /var/run -> /run symlink (gh-1142)

- New Features:
   * RETURN iptables target is now a variable: <returntype>
   * New type of operation: pass2allow, use fail2ban for "knocking",
     opening a closed port by swapping blocktype and returntype
   * New filters:
     - froxlor-auth - Thanks Joern Muehlencord
     - apache-pass - filter Apache access log for successful authentication
   * New actions:
     - shorewall-ipset-proto6 - using proto feature of the Shorewall. Still requires
	   manual pre-configuration of the shorewall. See the action file for detail.
   * New jails:
     - pass2allow-ftp - allows FTP traffic after successful HTTP authentication

- Enhancements:
   * action.d/cloudflare.conf - improved documentation on how to allow
     multiple CF accounts, and jail.conf got new compound action
     definition action_cf_mwl to submit cloudflare report.
   * Check access to socket for more detailed logging on error (gh-595)
   * fail2ban-testcases man page
   * filter.d/apache-badbots.conf, filter.d/nginx-botsearch.conf - add
     HEAD method verb
   * Revamp of Travis and coverage automated testing
   * Added a space between IP address and the following colon
     in notification emails for easier text selection
   * Character detection heuristics for whois output via optional setting
     in mail-whois*.conf. Thanks Thomas Mayer.
     Not enabled by default, if _whois_command is set to be
     %(_whois_convert_charset)s (e.g. in action.d/mail-whois-common.local),
     it
     - detects character set of whois output (which is undefined by
       RFC 3912) via heuristics of the file command
     - converts whois data to UTF-8 character set with iconv
     - sends the whois output in UTF-8 character set to mail program
     - avoids that heirloom mailx creates binary attachment for input with
       unknown character set


ver. 0.9.2 (2015/04/29) - better-quick-now-than-later
----------

- Fixes:
   * Fix ufw action commands
   * infinite busy loop on _escapedTags match in substituteRecursiveTags gh-907.
     Thanks TonyThompson
   * port[s] typo in jail.conf/nginx-http-auth gh-913. Thanks Frederik Wagner
     (fnerdwq)
   * $ typo in jail.conf. Thanks Skibbi. Debian bug #767255
   * grep'ing for IP in *mail-whois-lines.conf should now match also
     at the beginning and EOL.  Thanks Dean Lee
   * jail.conf
     - php-url-fopen: separate logpath entries by newline
   * failregex declared direct in jail was joined to single line (specifying of
     multiple expressions was not possible).
   * filters.d/exim.conf - cover different settings of exim logs
     details. Thanks bes.internal
   * filter.d/postfix-sasl.conf - failregex is now case insensitive
   * filters.d/postfix.conf - add 'Client host rejected error message' failregex
   * fail2ban/__init__.py - add strptime thread safety hack-around
   * recidive uses iptables-allports banaction by default now.
     Avoids problems with iptables versions not understanding 'all' for
     protocols and ports
   * filter.d/dovecot.conf
     - match pam_authenticate line from EL7
     - match unknown user line from EL7
   * Use use_poll=True for Python 2.7 and >=3.4 to overcome "Bad file
     descriptor" msgs issue (gh-161)
   * filter.d/postfix-sasl.conf - tweak failregex and add ignoreregex to ignore
     system authentication issues
   * fail2ban-regex reads filter file(s) completely, incl. '.local' file etc.
     (gh-954)
   * firewallcmd-* actions: split output into separate lines for grepping (gh-908)
   * Guard unicode encode/decode issues while storing records in the database.
     Fixes "binding parameter error (unsupported type)" (gh-973), thanks to kot
     for reporting
   * filter.d/sshd added regex for matching openSUSE ssh authentication failure
   * filter.d/asterisk.conf:
     - Dropped "Sending fake auth rejection" failregex since it incorrectly
	   targets the asterisk server itself
     - match "hacking attempt detected" logs

- New Features:
   - New filters:
     - postfix-rbl  Thanks Lee Clemens
     - apache-fakegooglebot.conf  Thanks Lee Clemens
     - nginx-botsearch  Thanks Frantisek Sumsal
     - drupal-auth  Thanks Lee Clemens
   - New recursive embedded substitution feature added:
     - `<<PREF>HOST>` becomes `<IPV4HOST>` for PREF=`IPV4`;
     - `<<PREF>HOST>` becomes `1.2.3.4` for PREF=`IPV4` and IPV4HOST=`1.2.3.4`;
   - New interpolation feature for config readers - `%(known/parameter)s`.
     (means last known option with name `parameter`). This interpolation makes
     possible to extend a stock filter or jail regexp in .local file
     (opposite to simply set failregex/ignoreregex that overwrites it),
     see gh-867.
   - Monit config for fail2ban in files/monit/
   - New actions:
     - action.d/firewallcmd-multiport and action.d/firewallcmd-allports Thanks Donald Yandt
     - action.d/sendmail-geoip-lines.conf
     - action.d/nsupdate to update DNSBL. Thanks Andrew St. Jean
   - New status argument for fail2ban-client -- flavor:
     fail2ban-client status <jail> [flavor]
     - empty or "basic" works as-is
     - "cymru" additionally prints (ASN, Country RIR) per banned IP
       (requires dnspython or dnspython3)
   - Flush log at USR1 signal

- Enhancements:
   * Enable multiport for firewallcmd-new action.  Closes gh-834
   * files/debian-initd migrated from the debian branch and should be
     suitable for manual installations now (thanks Juan Karlo de Guzman)
   * Define empty ignoreregex in filters which didn't have it to avoid
     warnings (gh-934)
   * action.d/{sendmail-*,xarf-login-attack}.conf - report local
     timezone not UTC time/zone. Closes gh-911
   * Conditionally log Ignore IP with reason (dns, ip, command). Closes gh-916
   * Absorbed DNSUtils.cidr into addr2bin in filter.py, added unittests
   * Added syslogsocket configuration to fail2ban.conf
   * Note in the jail.conf for the recidive jail to increase dbpurgeage (gh-964)


ver. 0.9.1 (2014/10/29) - better, faster, stronger
----------

- Refactoring (IMPORTANT -- Please review your setup and configuration):
   * iptables-common.conf replaced iptables-blocktype.conf
     (iptables-blocktype.local should still be read) and now also
     provides defaults for the chain, port, protocol and name tags

- Fixes:
   * start of file2ban aborted (on slow hosts, systemd considers the server has
     been timed out and kills him), see gh-824
   * UTF-8 fixes in pure-ftp thanks to Johannes Weberhofer. Closes gh-806.
   * systemd backend error on bad utf-8 in python3
   * badips.py action error when logging HTTP error raised with badips request

   * fail2ban-regex assertion error caused by miscount missed lines with
     multiline regex
   * Fix actions failing to execute for Python 3.4.0. Workaround for
     http://bugs.python.org/issue21207
   * Database now returns persistent bans on restart (bantime < 0)
   * Recursive action tags now fully processed. Fixes issue with bsd-ipfw
     action
   * Fixed TypeError with "ipfailures" and "ipjailfailures" action tags.
     Thanks Serg G. Brester
   * Correct times for non-timezone date times formats during DST
   * Pass a copy of, not original, aInfo into actions to avoid side-effects
   * Per-distribution paths to the exim's main log
   * Ignored IPs are no longer banned when being restored from persistent
     database
   * Manually unbanned IPs are now removed from persistent database, such they
     wont be banned again when Fail2Ban is restarted
   * Pass "bantime" parameter to the actions in default jail's action
     definition(s)
   * filters.d/sieve.conf - fixed typo in _daemon.  Thanks Jisoo Park

   - Added Cloudflare API action

- Enhancements
   * Start performance of fail2ban-client (and tests) increased, start time
     and cpu usage rapidly reduced. Introduced a shared storage logic, to
     bypass reading lots of config files (see gh-824).
     Thanks to Joost Molenaar for good catch (reported gh-820).
   * Fail2ban-regex - add print-all-matched option. Closes gh-652
   * Suppress fail2ban-client warnings for non-critical config options
   * Match non "Bye Bye" disconnect messages for sshd locked account regex

The minimum supported python version is now 2.6. If you have python-2.4 or 2.5
you can use the 0.8.12 version of fail2ban.

Please take note of release notes:
https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban/releases/tag/0.9.0

Please test your configuration before relying on it.

Nearly all development is thanks to Steven Hiscocks (THANKS!), merging,
testcases and timezone support from Daniel Black, and code-review and minor
additions from Yaroslav Halchenko.

- Refactoring (IMPORTANT -- Please review your setup and configuration):
   * [..bddbf1e] jail.conf was heavily refactored and now is similar
     to how it looked on Debian systems:
     - default action could be configured once for all jails
     - jails definitions only provide customizations (port, logpath)
     - no need to specify 'filter' if name matches jail name
   * [..5aef036] Core functionality moved into fail2ban/ module.
     Closes gh-26
     - tests included in module to aid testing and debugging
   * Added fail2ban persistent database
     - default location at /var/lib/fail2ban/fail2ban.sqlite3
     - allows active bans to be reinstated on restart
     - log files read from last position after restart
   * Added systemd journal backend
     - Dependency on python-systemd
     - New "journalmatch" option added to filter configs files
     - New "systemd-journal" option added to fail2ban-regex
   * Added python3 support
   * Support %z (Timezone offset) and %f (sub-seconds) support for
     datedetector. Enhanced existing date/time have been updated patterns to
     support these. ISO8601 now defaults to localtime unless specified otherwise.
     Some filters have been change as required to capture these elements in the
     right timezone correctly.
   * Log levels are now set by Syslog style strings e.g. DEBUG, ERROR.
     - Log level INFO is now more verbose
   * Optionally can read log files starting from "head" or "tail".
     - See "logpath" option in jail.conf(5) man page.
   * Can now set log encoding for files per jail.
     - Default uses systemd locale.

- New features:
   * [..c7ae460] Multiline failregex. Close gh-54
   * [8af32ed] Guacamole filter and support for Apache Tomcat date
     format
   * [..b6059f4] 'timeout' option for actions Close gh-60 and Debian bug
     #410077.  Also it would now capture and include stdout and stderr
     into logging messages in case of error or at DEBUG loglevel.
   * Added action xarf-login-attack to report formatted attack messages
     according to the XARF standard (v0.2). Close gh-105
   * Support PyPy
   * Add filter for apache-botsearch
   * Add filter for kerio. Thanks Tony Lawrence for blog of regexs and
     providing samples. Close gh-120
   * Filter for stunnel
   * Filter for Counter Strike 1.6. Thanks to onorua for logs.
     Close gh-347
   * Filter for squirrelmail. Close gh-261
   * Filter for tine20. Close gh-583

   * Python based actions can now be created.
     - SMTP action for sending emails on jail start, stop and ban.
   * Added action to use badips.com reporting and blacklist
     - Requires Python 2.7+

- Enhancements
   * Fail2ban-regex - don't accumulate lines if not printing them.
     add options to suppress output of missed/ignored lines. Close gh-644
   * Asterisk now supports syslog format
   * Jail names increased to 26 characters and iptables prefix reduced
     from fail2ban- to f2b- as suggested by buanzo in gh-462.
   * Multiline filter for sendmail-spam. Close gh-418
   * Multiline regex for Disconnecting: Too many authentication failures for
     root [preauth]\nConnection closed by 6X.XXX.XXX.XXX [preauth]
   * Multiline regex for Disconnecting: Connection from 61.XX.XX.XX port
     51353\nToo many authentication failures for root [preauth]. Thanks
     Helmut Grohne. Close gh-457
   * Replacing use of deprecated API (.warning, .assertEqual, etc)
   * [..a648cc2] Filters can have options now too which are substituted into
     failregex / ignoreregex
   * [..e019ab7] Multiple instances of the same action are allowed in the
     same jail -- use actname option to disambiguate.
   * Add honeypot email address to exim-spam filter as argument
   * Properties and methods of actions accessible from fail2ban-client
     - Use of properties replaces command actions "cinfo" interface

ver. 0.8.11 (2013/11/13) - loves-unittests-and-tight-DoS-free-filter-regexes
----------

In light of CVE-2013-2178 that triggered our last release we have put
a significant effort into tightening all of the regexs of our filters
to avoid another similar vulnerability. All filters have been updated
and some to catch more login/authentication failures and to support
for newer application versions. There are test cases for most log
cases of failures now.

As usual, if you have other examples that demonstrate that a filter is
insufficient, or if we have inadvertently introduced a regression,
please provide us with example log lines on the github issue tracker
http://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban/issues and NOT on a random blog in
some obscure corner of the Internet.

Many thanks to our contributors for this release Daniel Black, Yaroslav
Halchenko, Steven Hiscocks, Mark McKinstry, Andy Fragen, Orion Poplawski,
Alexander Dietrich, JP Espinosa, Jamyn Shanley, Beau Raines, François
Boulogne and others who have helped on IRC and mailing list, logged issues
and bug requests.

- IMPORTANT incompatible changes:
  Filter name changes:
   * 'lighttpd-fastcgi' filter has been renamed to 'suhosin'
   * 'sasl' has been renamed to 'postfix-sasl'
   * 'exim' spam catching failregexes was split out into 'exim-spam'
  These changes will require changing jail.{conf,local} if any of
  those filters were used.

- Fixes:
  Jonathan Lanning
   * filter.d/asterisk -- identified another regex for blocking. Also channel
     ID is hex not decimal as noted in sample logs provided.
  Daniel Black & Marcel Dopita
   * filter.d/apache-auth -- fixed and apache auth samples provide. Closes gh-286
  Yaroslav Halchenko
   * filter.d/common.conf -- make colon after [daemon] optional. Closes gh-267
   * filter.d/apache-common.conf -- support apache 2.4 more detailed error
     log format.  Closes gh-268
   * Backends changes detection and parsing. Close gh-223 and gh-103:
     - Polling backend: detect changes in the files not only based on
       mtime, but also on the size and inode.  It should allow for
       better detection of changes and log rotations on busy servers,
       older python 2.4, and file systems with precision of mtime only
       up to a second (e.g. ext3).
     - All backends, possible race condition: do not read from a file
       initially reported empty.  Originally could have lead to
       accounting for detected log lines multiple times.
     - Do not crash if executing a command in fail2ban-client interactive
       mode has failed (e.g. due to incorrect syntax). Closes gh-353
  Daniel Black & Мернов Георгий
   * filter.d/dovecot.conf -- Fix when no TLS enabled - line doesn't end in ,

   * filter.d/exim.conf -- regex hardening and extra failure examples in
     sample logs

  Daniel Black
   * action.d/hostsdeny -- NOTE: new dependency 'ed'. Switched to use 'ed' across
     all platforms to ensure permissions are the same before and after a ban.
     Closes gh-266. hostsdeny supports daemon_list now too.
   * action.d/bsd-ipfw - action option unused. Change blocktype to port unreach
     instead of deny for consistancy.
   * filter.d/dovecot - added to support different dovecot failure
     "..disallowed plaintext auth". Closes Debian bug #709324
   * filter.d/roundcube-auth - timezone offset can be positive or negative
   * action.d/bsd-ipfw - action option unused. Fixed to blocktype for
     consistency. default to port unreach instead of deny

     http://www.unchartedbackwaters.co.uk/files/dropbear/dropbear-0.52.patch
     and add PAM is it in dropbear-2013.60 source code.
   * filter.d/{asterisk,assp,dovecot,proftpd}.conf -- regex hardening
     and extra failure examples in sample logs
   * filter.d/apache-auth - added expressions for mod_authz, mod_auth and
     mod_auth_digest failures.
   * filter.d/recidive -- support f2b syslog target and anchor regex at start
   * filter.d/mysqld-auth.conf - mysql can use syslog
   * filter.d/sshd - regex enhancements to support openssh-6.3. Closes Debian
     bug #722970. Thanks Colin Watson for the regex analysis.
   * filter.d/wuftpd - regex enhancements to support pam and wuftpd. Closes
     Debian bug #665925
  Rolf Fokkens
   * action.d/dshield.conf and complain.conf -- reorder mailx arguments.
     https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=998020
  John Doe (ache)
   * action.d/bsd-ipfw.conf - invert actionstop logic to make exist status 0.
     Closes gh-343.
  JP Espinosa (Reviewed by O.Poplawski)
   * files/redhat-initd - rewritten to use stock init.d functions thus
     avoiding problems with getpid.  Also $network and iptables moved
     to Should- rc init fields
  Rick Mellor
   * filter.d/vsftp - fix capture with tty=ftp

- New Features:
  Edgar Hoch

  Daniel Black
   * reorder parsing of jail.conf, jail.d/*.conf, jail.local, jail.d/*.local
     and likewise for fail2ban.{conf|local|d/*.conf|d/*.local}. Closes gh-392
   * jail.conf now has asterisk jail - no need for asterisk-tcp and

  startup of fail2ban, fail2ban will do "maxreinit" attempts to initialize its
  own firewall. It will sleep between attempts for "polltime" number of seconds
  (closes Debian: #334272). Thanks to Yaroslav Halchenko
- Added "interpolations" in fail2ban.conf. This is provided by the ConfigParser
  module. Old configuration files still work. Thanks to Yaroslav Halchenko

  * Added a cleanup of firewall rules on emergency shutdown when unknown
    exception is catched.
  * Fail2ban should not crash now if a wrong file name is specified in config.

    and then only loglevel (verbose, debug) is processed, so the warning could
    be seen in the logs
  * Added a keyword <section> in parsing of the subject and the body of an email
    sent out by fail2ban (closes: #330311)

ver. 0.5.4 (2005/09/13) - beta
----------
